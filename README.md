# UofC-ENGG233-Assignments
Assignments given to me in a first year engineering course at the University of Calgary


Lab Assignments have descriptions within them that contain the purpose of each assignment
Lab Assignments will increase in difficulty as the number increases.
Final project is a simulation which recieves excell data from a hypothetical car's dashboard and presents it digitally

These were all used for submission for ENGG233 at the University of Calgary
Please do not plagiarise for your own assignments :):)
